# sandboxlighting
s&amp;box lighting that can detect the average light levels the player is facing. This is currently used on the client only in my demo.  If anyone knows how to optimise this (such as caching lights and updating cache dynamically such as new light added or property of light has been changed- please go ahead!). 

also it comes with code you might not need such as screen effects/depth of field. feel free to rip that out


edit: someone please make Amnesia inspired game now. thx!
